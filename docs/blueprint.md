# **App Name**: SimuMeet

## Core Features:

- Simulated Participant Count: Generates a simulated, fluctuating participant count, convincingly mimicking a live meeting environment using a timeout function. The numbers increase or decrease randomly.
- Interactive Drawing Canvas: Offers a digital drawing canvas with a glassy, translucent black background, suitable for tutorials and presentations.
- Conditional Chat Access: Allows a moderator (e.g., the teacher) to enable or disable the chat functionality for participants.
- AI-Powered Chat Interactions: Integrates OpenRouter API to provide human-like responses within the chat.  The system uses a tool that reasons about the user query to determine how and when to incorporate the prompt.
- .env File Configuration: Uses a `.env` file to securely store and access the OpenRouter API key.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) for a professional and calming atmosphere.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F2FA), almost white, creating a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Vivid orange (#FF9800) to highlight interactive elements and important information. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, objective look.
- Use flat, minimalist icons with consistent styling, mainly in the primary and accent colors.
- A clean and modern layout, with clear sections for the simulated participant count, drawing canvas, and chat interface. Ensure all elements are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback for user actions (e.g., button clicks, chat messages). Employ smooth transitions for the simulated participant count fluctuations.
